# PHP Type Juggling and Loose Comparison Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to type juggling and the use of the loose comparison operator (`==`).  Loose comparison can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types.

The `bug.php` file shows an example where a string and an integer are compared using `==`, resulting in unexpected equality due to PHP's automatic type conversion.  The `bugSolution.php` file illustrates the correct use of strict comparison (`===`) to avoid this issue.

This example highlights the importance of using strict comparison (`===`) in PHP, particularly when dealing with user input or data from external sources where you need to be sure about both the value and the data type.
