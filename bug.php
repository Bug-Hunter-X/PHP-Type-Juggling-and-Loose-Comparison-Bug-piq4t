This code suffers from a subtle bug related to PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.  When comparing values of different types, PHP often performs type coercion before the comparison. This can lead to unexpected results.

```php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Equal";
} else {
  echo "Not equal";
}
```

This code will output "Equal" because PHP converts the string '10' to an integer 10 before the comparison.

However, if you use the strict equality operator `===`, it checks for both value and type equality. 

```php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Equal";
} else {
  echo "Not equal";
}
}
```

Now, the output will be "Not equal" because the type of $a (string) and $b (integer) are different.
